forms
I create a form function to which I pass two arguments
formSelector - form
modalTimerId - a timer that opens a modal window after a certain period of time
1) I create a variable to receive all forms by the form tag
2) I create an object with messages that will be displayed when the form is sent to the server
3) I am creating a function that will be responsible for linking the posting
* I make it so that we receive all the data filled by the user in js
* form Data is a special object that allows you to form all the data filled by the user from a certain form, it also forms a key-value format
4) I clean the form when all the data has been loaded
5) I make the message disappear after a few seconds
6) I bind under all postData forms
7) I make modal windows with thanks, after filling the modal window and place our message on the page
